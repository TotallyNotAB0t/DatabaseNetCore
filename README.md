# DatabaseNetCore
Database created in C# Using the .NET Core framework. I used the MVC model and modified from here.  
Contains a log-in system when you want to add / edit / delete a key.

Executable is in bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/publish/DatabaseNetCore.exe  

You then have to go to http://localhost:5000 and can mess around with the base :)
